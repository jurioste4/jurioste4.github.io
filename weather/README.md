Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)



## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data

I created a website or each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. I was createing visualizations and their corresponding explanations for the data . I  also have created  landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

I used bootstrap as well as some java and html and CSS 


[weather data](Resources/cities.csv).
