## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
I built this website using data and work that was done with the project 
https://github.com/jurioste4/Python_api_homework/blob/master/api_weather/my_code/WeatherPy.ipynb

This website I took the plots and image from my python project with Link to that above 
I Used HTML/CSS and some JavaScript as well as bootstrap
Main website is index.html with each graph getting a page 
Humidity.html, maxtemp.html, cloudiness.html and testcon.html
All are linked from the main web page.

I created a python scrip located in ##convert_CSV_HTML.ipynb to convert ##cities.csv under resources from csv to html.
Resulting in convertcsv.htm 
Can see the table under data nav bar button.

I used Visual studio code to create the site   https://jurioste4.github.io/weather/index.html
Thank you for your time
