#JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background



I needed to  create a table dynamically based upon data set (Code/static/js/data.js). I was also tasked with letting users  filter the table data for specific values.  I was only use to use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. 

code is located in static/js for javascrip files 
CSS is located with in [static/CSS]
index.html is located in [static] folder. 


### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page  [index.html](Code/index.html).

* I used  UFO dataset  in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  
###  Multiple Search Categories 

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
