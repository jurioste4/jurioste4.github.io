        <p class="discription" style="font-size: 30px">&emsp;
            This ride sharing analysis was done with data used from both Lyft and Uber the data is from 2018 
            and has rides with city active driver and historic rides with city and driver count with individual fares and city type.

        <h1 class="frame" align="center">Bubble plot Average Fare vs Total Rides</h1>

         <p class="iframe" align="right" style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:30px;">This bubble plot with average fare for the y axis and Total rides for x axis 
             separated by city type with bubble size being total drivers.
                What I found interesting is Rural cities have a higher average fare but lower total drivers and total rides. 
                And Urban cities have a higher total rides more drivers but the average fare is lower .  
            
                
    
            </p>

            <h1 class="iframe2" align="center">Pie charts: Total far and total rides by city type</h1>
            <p class="frame2" align="center" style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:30px;">One Pie Graph Is total fare by city type the second graph is total rides by city type.
                This data is from 2018 and it Shows  that Urban cities has over 62.7% of the fair when comparing the other two city types. 
                 Which the increase is due to Urban having  over 68.4% of the other ride types.
